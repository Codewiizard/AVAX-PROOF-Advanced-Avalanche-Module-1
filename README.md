# AVAX-PROOF-Advanced-Avalanche-Module-1
This repository contains two Solidity smart contracts:

1. **ERC20 Contract**: A basic ERC20 token implementation.
2. **Vault Contract**: A contract that allows users to deposit and withdraw ERC20 tokens while managing shares of the total supply in the vault.

## Contracts Overview

### 1. ERC20 Token Contract

The `ERC20` contract is a simplified implementation of the ERC20 token standard. It provides the core functionalities such as token transfers, approval, minting, and burning.

#### Features

- **Token Information**:
  - `name`: "DEFIEMP"
  - `symbol`: "DEF"
  - `decimals`: 18 (standard for ERC20 tokens)
  
- **Functions**:
  - `transfer(recipient, amount)`: Transfers tokens from the sender to the recipient.
  - `approve(owner, spender, amount)`: Approves a spender to spend a specific amount of tokens on behalf of the owner.
  - `transferFrom(sender, recipient, amount)`: Transfers tokens from one address to another, using the allowance mechanism.
  - `mint(amount)`: Mints new tokens to the caller's account.
  - `burn(amount)`: Burns tokens from the caller's account.

#### Events

- **Transfer**: Emitted on token transfers, including minting and burning.
- **Approval**: Emitted when an allowance is set via the `approve` function.

### 2. Vault Contract

The **Vault** contract is a smart contract built on Ethereum (or any EVM-compatible chain) that allows users to deposit ERC20 tokens and receive shares in return. These shares represent the userâ€™s ownership of the tokens in the vault, and users can redeem their shares to withdraw their portion of the vault's assets.

## Features

- **Deposit Tokens**: Users can deposit ERC20 tokens into the vault and receive a proportional amount of shares in return.
- **Withdraw Tokens**: Users can burn their shares to withdraw a corresponding amount of tokens from the vault.
- **Share-based System**: The vault uses a share system to track the proportional ownership of each user relative to the total token balance in the vault.

## Mathematical Model

- **Deposit Formula**:
  - Shares minted (`s`) = `(amount * totalSupply) / token balance before deposit`
  - If the vault is empty (`totalSupply == 0`), shares minted are equal to the deposited amount.

- **Withdrawal Formula**:
  - Amount withdrawn (`a`) = `(shares * token balance before withdraw) / totalSupply`

## How It Works

1. **Install Avalanche CLI**
   - Install avalanche-cli on your UNIX system.
   - Copy ERC20.sol and Vault.sol from this repository.
   - Create you custom subnet on Ubuntu Terminal.
   - In a terminal, run: ```avalanche subnet create <any-subnet-name>```
   - Select the desired options , go with defaults if new.
   - Create chain ID (any positve digits).
   - Deploy you subnet using the command ```avalanche subnet deploy <your-subnet-name>```.
   - Details such as RPC URL , Funded address ,Network name, Chain ID ,Currency Symbol,private key will appear . Use these information to add a new network on Metamask .
   - Switch to the newly created network and import new account using the private key dispalyed in the network information box.

2. **Deploy Contract:**
   - In Remix IDE, select "Injected Web3" as the environment.
   - Deploy ```ERC20.sol``` first.
   - Then deploy ```Vault.sol```, using the deployed address of ```erc20.sol``` as the constructor parameter.

3. **Mint and Deposit Tokens:**
   - Mint some tokens to your address using the mint function in ```ERC20.sol```.
   - Deposit some tokens and receive shares in return using ```Vault.sol```.
